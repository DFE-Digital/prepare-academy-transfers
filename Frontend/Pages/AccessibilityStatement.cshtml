            The Manage an Academy Transfer service is run by the Service Design and Delivery team at
            the Department for Education (DfE).
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We're committed to enabling you to use this service. It's designed so that you can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible the website is</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            <li>
                <p class="govuk-body">some primary button labels are not consistent, but have been defined based on user research</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    on some pages the main heading may not be read out correctly using some screen readers.
                    This is a known issue with the gds pattern for example where the heading is placed within a group of elements such as when
                    a radio button is displayed and the question is also the heading
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            The Department of Education (DfE) is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
        </p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Main headings on some pages are contained within groups of elements and so may not be read out correctly by some screen reader software.
            This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Some labelling on primary action buttons are not consistent. The labels were selected to give users a better description of the purpose of the action based on user research.
            This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria 3.2.4 (Consistent Identification).
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-7">
            We are looking into the two issues raised above and aim to resolve these in a future iteration of the service.
